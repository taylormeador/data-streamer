# data-streamer

This project is intended to be a prototype of a scalable data platform.
The platform will ingest data from IoT devices of various types, which will be simulated using a tool or script. After ingestion, analytics will be available about the devices from a REST API.
Since this is meant to be scalable, I want to test its limits and identify bottlenecks, at which point I can rearchitect the project to increase performance.
An ancillary goal is to learn Kafka and Redis on a more in depth level.
